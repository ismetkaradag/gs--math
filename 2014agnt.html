                                    This is a two-week long research summer school on algebraic geometry
                                    and related number theory. Topics to be included are Computational
                                    commutative algebra, Subvarieties of low degree in projective spaces,
                                    sheaf cohomology, Singular points of complex hypersurfaces, Birational
                                    geometry of moduli spaces, Arakelov theory and Hypergeometric Galois
                                    actions. We plan to deliver a series of preparatory lectures before the
                                    summer school. There will be a possibility for young researchers to
                                    present short research talks and make poster presentations. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    First week of the summer school will be devoted to general lectures.
                                    Specialized courses and research talks will be delivered in the second
                                    week. You can <a href="documents/2014agnt-schedule-week1.pdf">find the schedule

                                <br>
                                The role of computational methods in algebraic geometry may be compared
                                with that of computers in dealing with problems in combinatorics.
                                Computers opened up a tool to settle problems such as the four color
                                problem which was inaccessible before. Likewise, the computer algebra
                                systems have provided strong tools to handle questions in the field
                                which would be inaccessible in the absence of this approach. Algebraic
                                geometry, even in its abstract sense of scheme theory, is basically the
                                study of ideals generated by polynomials over a field. The Gröbner
                                Bases Theory, the main idea in computational methods, descends the
                                study of polynomial ideals to the study of monomial ideals. The
                                structure of monomial ideals have combinatorial nature and, in most
                                cases, the original question on polynomial ideals, is much easier to
                                handle for monomial ideals. Groebner Bases Theory has wast applications
                                in several branches of mathematics and hence, it is important for
                                working mathematicians to get familiar with this useful theory. <br>
                                The aim of the course in this CIMPA program, is to introduce the main
                                techniques in the subject, the so called Gröbner Basis. These include,
                                monomial orders, Gröbner bases, the division algorithm, Buckberger
                                criterion and Buchberger algorithm, comparisons of an ideal and its
                                initial ideal in the ring of polynomials, elimination of variable,
                                intersection of ideals (and, generic initial ideals if time permits).
                                These topics could well be accompanied by problem sessions working with
                                systems of computer algebra such as CoCoA and SINGULAR.<br>

                                The study of the geometry of subvarieties of the complex projective
                                space defined by homogeneous equations of low degrees (and in
                                particular, hypersurfaces, which are defined by one such equation) is a
                                very classical subject. For example, the fact that a smooth cubic
                                surface contains 27 lines was first discovered by Cayley in a 1869
                                memoir. In another direction, some of these varieties have long been
                                known to be unirational (i.e., parametrizable in a generically
                                finite-to-one fashion by a projective space of the same dimension), but
                                it is only in the 1970s that they were proved not to be rational (i.e.,
                                parametrizable in a generically one-to-one fashion by a projective
                                space of the same dimension). Still today, nobody knows any example of
                                a smooth non rational cubic hypersurface of dimension 4. Nowadays, a
                                lot of information has been gathered on this very rich circle of
                                questions. I will illustrate this still very active domain of research
                                by treating in some detail a few examples.<br>

                                <br>
                                Since their introduction by Leray, Cartan, and Serre in the forties and
                                fifties, sheaves and their cohomology have been an extremely useful
                                tool in topology, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry. One can
                                even say that they are indispensable in modern algebraic geometry. The
                                purpose of this course is to introduce students to some of the powerful
                                techniques in sheaf cohomology not usually taught in a standard course
                                on algebraic geometry. We will discuss four types of cohomology
                                theories---sheaf cohomology in terms of resolutions, Čech cohomology of
                                a sheaf, hypercohomology of a complex of sheaves, and Čech cohomology
                                of a complex of sheaves, the relations among them, and how to compute
                                them using spectral sequences. As evidence of their power and
                                versatility, we deduce the Dolbeault theorem, the classical (smooth) de
                                Rham theorem, the analytic de Rham theorem, and as the pièce de
                                résistance, Grothendieck's algebraic de Rham theorem. <br>

                                curves, Kontsevich moduli spaces of stable maps and Hilbert schemes of
                                points on the plane. After introducing the necessary background from
                                birational geometry, I will discuss the cone of ample and effective
                                divisors, the stable base locus decomposition of the effective cone and
                                the corresponding birational models.<br>

                                Arakelov geometry is a combination of algebraic geometry of schemes and
                                analytic complex geometry. Given a variety X over the integers, one
                                studies hermitian vector bundles over X. Characteristic classes are
                                defined for these, and a Riemann-Roch theorem is proved. Applications
                                include equidistribution results of Galois orbits and computations of
                                the periods of some CM motives.<br>

                                Arakelov Geometry is a way of completing the
                                integers by introducing metrics at infinity so as to
                                be able to define degrees of (metrized) line bundles on arithmetic
                                schemes. In this series of talks I will try to
                                explain the most basic situation in the case of arithmetic surfaces.
                                The theory had applications in the proofs
                                of the Tate and Mordell's conjectures and results on

                      <p><big><b>Hypergeometric Galois Actions</b></big> <br>
                    There is a system of subgroups of the modular group which originates
                    from geometry and is deeply connected with hypergeometric functions.
                    This lecture is about the construction of these subgroups from the
                    study of lattices in projective unitary groups PU(1,n), which goes back
                    to Picard. After works of Terada, Deligne and Mostow an essential
                    contribution was made by Thurston who interpreted the space of flat
                    cone metrics on a surface as another model of the Teichmuller space.
                    His results led to the classification of sphere triangulations with
                    non-negative curvature, which are represented by some special points of
                    a moduli space. These triangulations may find real-life application in
                    construction of geodesic domes and they have an interpretation as
                    special dessins. Some general and complementary results in this
                    direction were obtained by Fillastre and Troyanov. Our aim is on the
                    one hand to complete these result by studying degenerate families of
                    triangulations and on the other hand to generalize them to more general
                    families of triangulations. Determination of their Belyi maps is a
                    difficult arithmetic-related problem for general graphs. In our case
                    these graphs are very special and so there is a hope to find their
                    rational maps explicitly and study the galois action on them. We also
                    propose an alternative problem that concerns the study of ``small''
                    subgroups of the modular group from the point of view of Teichmüller
                    theory. Degenerate triangulations with combinatorial curvature
                    provide an easy access to the research problem and their study will
                    quickly yield results complementing those of Thurston's. There are also
                    a bunch of problems on fields of definitions of the corresponding
                    dessins.<br>

                                    theory.</b> <br> A theorem of Faltings says that that an abelian variety defined
                                over a number field is determined (up to isogeny) by its $p$-adic Tate module (which is
                                a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module of finite rank, on which the absolute Galois group acts),
                                for any prime $p$. This is one way of realizing the central importance of Galois
                                representations in Number Theory. It turns out that one can place these objects in
                                $p$-adic families and study the variation of the arithmetic data they encode. This is
                                essentially the main idea behind Iwasawa theory of Galois deformations. This approach
                                has proved immensely useful and has lead to some of the most spectacular advances in
                                Mathematics: Wiles' (and Taylor-Wiles') proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture,
                                Buzzard-Taylor's proof of the strong Artin conjecture for $GL_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$,
                                Taylor's proof of the Sato-Tate conjecture and Kisin's proof of Fontaine-Mazur
                                conjecture for $GL_2$ has relied on the understanding deformations of Galois
                                representations of various kind.<br><br>

                                1- Gauss' conjecture on the ideal class groups of quadratic fields and the rather
                                erratic "horizontal" behavior.<br>

                                3- Iwasawa's theorem on the behavior of the class groups along the cyclotomic tower and
                                classical Iwasawa theory (= study of the universal deformations of characters).<br>
                                4- Modular Galois representations, the eigencurve and the infinite fern of Gouvea-Mazur.

                    important problems in arithmetic: Wiles and Taylor/Wiles proved the
                    Shimura-Taniyama conjecture (to conclude with the proof of FLT),
                    Buzzard/Taylor and Taylor used it to prove many cases of the (strong)
                    Artin conjecture. In this talk, I will first give a general outline of
                    Mazur's abstract theory and explain how this circle of ideas may be
                    used to attack concrete arithmetic problems, such as the conjecture of
                    Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for elliptic curves.</big><br>-->

                                <p>Beware of dangerous and inconsiderate driving, especially when
                                    crossing roads. Even if you are on a pedestrian crossing, look
                                    carefully before crossing. Turkey is a comparatively safe country as
                                    far as crime is concerned, but it is best to take reasonable
                                    precautions against pickpockets in crowded areas.</p>
