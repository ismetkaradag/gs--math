              <em>The dynamics of non-strictly convex Hilbert geometries</em><br><br>

              Any open, properly convex domain $\Omega$ in $\R\P^n$ admits a Hilbert metric, compatible with a Finsler
              norm. Of particular interest are compact quotients of $\Omega$ by discrete subgroups of $\PGL(n+1,\R)$.
              The dynamical, topological, algebraic, and regularity properties of such quotients with the line flow have
              been exhaustively studied by Benoist and others in the case that $\Omega$ is strictly convex and
              consequently $\delta$-hyperbolic. My agenda is to expand previous studies to the convex but not strictly
              convex case for $\Omega$. In this talk, I will introduce a class of higher dimensional examples,
              constructed by Benoist, which exhibit some hyperbolicity properties. I will explicitly describe the
              topological and ergodic dynamical properties of the line flow on the projective triangle, which plays a
              focal role as an obstruction to hyperbolicity in the non-strictly convex examples of Benoist. I will
              assure you that we expect this obstruction to be surmountable.

              <em>Nilpotent groups and their sub-Finsler geometry</em><br><br>
              I will discuss the structure of finitely generated nilpotent groups and their large-scale geometry. I'll
              build up some of the Mal'cev theory for nilpotent groups and explain Pansu's theorems describing their
              asymptotic geometry in very concrete terms. One theme will be exploring how the geometry of the limit
              metric gives information about the discrete group.

              <em>Margulis cusps of hyperbolic 4-manifolds</em><br><br>

              Consider a discrete subgroup G of the isometry group of hyperbolic n-space and a parabolic fixed point p.
              The Margulis region consists of all points in the space that are moved a small distance by an isometry in
              the stabilizer of p in G, and is kept precisely invariant under this stabilizer. In dimensions 2 and 3 the
              Margulis region is always a horoball, which gives the well-understood picture of the parabolic cusps in
              the quotient manifold. In higher dimensions, due to the existence of screw-translations (parabolic
              isometries with a rotational part), this is no longer true. When the screw-translation has an irrational
              rotation, the shape of the corresponding region depends on the continued fraction expansion of the
              irrational angle. In this talk we describe the asymptotic shape of the Margulis region in hyperbolic
              4-space corresponding to an irrational screw-translation. As a consequence we show that the corresponding
              parabolic cusps are bi-Lipschitz rigid. As a corollary to the asymptotic shape we also obtain a necessary
              discreteness condition for isometry groups of hyperbolic 4-space, which can be viewed as a generalization
              of Shimizu's and Jorgensen's conditions in lower dimensions. This is joint work with Saeed Zakeri.

              <em>Coxeter groups in Hilbert Geometry</em><br><br>
              I will present a construction of convex bodies Omega of the real projective space which admit discrete
              subgroup of automorphism Gamma such that the quotient Omega/Gamma is compact, or of finite volume or
              convex-cocompact or geometrically finite. This construction is a given by a Theorem of Tits Vinberg and
              uses Coxeter group.

              After, i will discuss the geometrical properties of general quotient Omega/Gamma and moduli space of
              convex projective manifold (a.k.a such quotient Omega/Gamma).

              <em>Compatibility of two-dimensional conformal and projective structures and applications to Finsler
                2-spheres of constant curvature.</em><br><br>

              Recall that a projective structure P on a manifold M is an equivalence class of affine torsion-free
              connections on TM where two such connections are called equivalent if they share the same unparametrised
              geodesics. A conformal structure [g] on M is called compatible with a given projective structure P if P
              contains a connection preserving [g]. In this talk I will show that the space of conformal structures
              compatible with a projective structure P is given by the kernel of a projectively invariant quasi-linear
              first order differential operator. Furthermore, in the surface case, I will show that the conformal
              structures compatible with P are in one-to-one correspondence with certain holomorphic curves in a disk
              bundle over M. These results allow to rederive a Theorem of Bryant about rectilinear Finsler structures of
              constant curvature on the 2-sphere.

              <em>Rough homotheties on metric spaces</em><br><br>

              I would like to talk rough homotheties on metric spaces. It is
              known that if a Finsler space is not isometric to a Minkowski space, the Finsler space does not admit any
              k-homothety with k\ne 1. Motivated by this theorem, I would like to consider the existence problem of
              rough homotheties (rough similarites) on metric spaces. I will deal with the hyperbolic disk. If time
              permits, I will discuss the problem for
              Teichmuller space.

              <em>Introduction to Hilbert geometries</em><br><br>

              Hilbert geometries are defined in the interior of a convex set and are a generalisation of the Klein model
              (or projective model) of the Hyperbolic geometry. The aim of these lectures will be to introduce the
              audience to the main properties of these metric spaces and some of the current questions.

              <em>Convex Bodies in the Euclidiean, Spherical, Hyperbolic and Teichmuller Spaces</em><br><br>

              The goal for the series of lectures is to convey the importance of convexity and to share the ideas used
              in understanding the geometric properties of convex bodies appearing in various contexts in mathematics. I
              will start with the Euclidean convex bodies, and its associated Finsler geometry, and then generalize the
              arguments to curved spaces, including the sphere, the hyperbolic space, and finally the Teichmuller space.
              Some knowledge of Riemannian geometry and Riemann surfaces would be helpful, but not necessary.

                <p><b>How to go to Harem Hotel from Atatürk airport?</b>: there are
                  3 or more ways: <br>
                  *&nbsp; First and easist way, of course taking a taxi to Harem, it will
                  cost ~80TRY (1,5 hour). Especially prefer this way after midnight,
                  beacuse you may not find a ferry or a tram after midnight.<br>
                  *&nbsp; Second way, get on a Metro at the Ataturk airport and change it
                  to tram at Zeytinburnu. Get off from the tram at Sirkeci. Then get on a
                  ferry from Sirkeci to Harem and cross the sea (To ceheck the
                  Sirkeci-Harem ferry schedule, please<a
                    href="http://www.tarifeyebak.com/content/ido-sirkeci-harem-arabali-vapur-seferleri-yaz-2012">
                    click here</a>). When you reach the Harem ferry port, on the top of
                  hill you will see the Harem hotel, walk up to there. *&nbsp;Third, if
                  you miss the Sirkeci tram station or in that hour if there is no ferry
                  from Sirkeci to Harem, you can get on a ferry/boat either from Eminönü
                  or Karaköy or Beşiktaş to Üsküdar. Then, get on a dolmuş from Üsküdar
                  to Harem, and get of near the Harem Otogar, or take a taxi. </p>
                <p><b>How to go to Harem hotel from Sabiha Gökçen airport?</b>:
                  there are 2 ways: <br>
                  *&nbsp; First and easist way, of course taking a taxi to Üsküdar, it
                  will cost ~70TRY (1 hour). <br>
                  *&nbsp; Second but cheapest way, havataş shuttles. Get on a havataş
                  shuttle to Kadıköy (12 TRY, check the shuttle schedule
                  from <a href="http://www.sabihagokcen.aero/havatas_shuttle">here</a>),
                  and then take a taxi to Harem (10 TRY). </p>
                <p><b>How to go to Galatasaray University from Harem hotel?</b><br>
                  First walk down up to main street, then get on a dolmuş to Üsküdar
                  (if you are four people, you can take a taxi, it will totally cost
                  cheaper than dolmuş's.) and get off at Üsküdar.
                  Probably the driver will drop you before ferry port. Do not worry, just
                  follow the crowd (If you have time, it is suggested to walk along the
                  seaside to Üsküdar from the hotel (30 minutes), you will have great
                  times).
                  Get on a ferry/boat from Üskdar to Beşiktaş and cross the Bosphorus
                  (you will really enjoy this trip). When you arrive to Beşiktaş, walk 15
                  minutes along Çırağan street (the main street parallel to the sea) in
                  the direction of Ortaköy, then you will see the main entrance of the
                  university on the right. </p>
