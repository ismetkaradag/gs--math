                        Başlık/Titre/Title: Polynomial Real Root Certification using Hermite Matrices over Q
                        <br><br>

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: Polynomial systems can be solved reliably using numerical homotopy
                        methods. These methods return numerical approximations to solutions, and all the implementations
                        validate the solutions heuristically. Therefore, the output, the approximate solutions of
                        polynomial systems are not certified. Even though the approximate solutions work well in
                        practice, they cannot be used in critical applications, especially in pure mathematics or when
                        high precision is needed (e.g. Surgical Robot arm applications).
                        Let I be a zero dimensional and radical ideal generated by m polynomials with exact rational
                        coefficients. Assume that we are given approximations for the common exact roots.
                        In this talk, we show how to construct and certify the rational entries of Hermite matrices for
                        I from the approximate roots. Furthermore, we represent a method to certify the real roots of
                        the given polynomial system using the signature of Hermite matrices.

                        Başlık/Titre/Title: On a special family cyclic codes and their applications
                        <br><br>

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: Coding theory is a field that allows us to construct methods to transfer
                        and store data in a way that can detect
                        and correct corruptions that may occur during the transmission process. Algebraic coding theory
                        uses algebraic structures to construct
                        these methods. Cyclic codes, which are very useful due to their algebraic properties, have a
                        central importance in algebraic coding theory.
                        m-adic residue codes are a type of codes that generates cyclic codes with the help of residue
                        classes. After briefly talking about
                        algebraic coding theory, I will describe cyclic codes and m-adic residue codes. Then, after
                        briefly summarizing the DNA codes, I will
                        explain the relationship between m-adic residue codes and these codes. Finally, I will talk
                        about quantum codes and explain their
                        relationship with m-adic residue codes.

                        Başlık/Titre/Title: Nonlocal Vibration Analysis of 3-D Plates Using Riesz-Caputo Fractional
                        Derivative.
                        <br><br>

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: In this study, nonlocal vibration analyzes of 3-D plates modeled are
                        performed with the help of
                        fractional mechanics. The Riesz-Caputo fractional derivative is used to define nonlocality
                        without using kernel functions. The frequency spectrum and mode shapes of the plates are
                        investigated for different fractional derivative orders ($\alpha$) and different length scale
                        parameters (l). The main contributions
                        of these studies are that the nonlocal approach considering fractional analysis give results
                        closer to the experimental
                        results than the classical theory.

                        Başlık/Titre/Title: Induction and restriction on symmetry groups of binary trees
                        <br><br>

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: Symmetry groups of binary trees are isomorphic to iterated wreath
                        products of symmetric groups of order two. In our
                        collaboration with Mee Seong Im, our aim was to describe the relations between induction and
                        restriction on representations of this
                        tower of groups, which embed into each other. Even though we didn't get a full description of
                        the relevant category, we have partial
                        results concerning the vector space and algebra structure of certain hom spaces. In the talk I
                        will focus on the origin of the problem
                        and various approaches we found helpful during our research.

                        Başlık/Titre/Title: Isolated points on Modular Curves
                        <br><br>

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: One of the oldest areas of mathematics is the study of integer or
                        rational solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients and it remains active till
                        today.
                        The most natural question we can ask about such an equation is whether its set of rational
                        solutions is finite or infinite. This can be determined by the genus of the
                        curve defined by such equations. In particular, if the genus is greater than one, there are
                        finitely many rational points on a curve.


                        <p>
                            What happens when one allows for solutions involving square-roots of integers or cubic
                            roots? Perhaps in general all complex numbers that are
                            roots of a degree d polynomial? We call such solutions of degree 2,3 or d in general.
                            In this talk, we will discuss when a curve has infinitely many degree d points focusing
                            particularly on points on modular curves

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: We approach the Torelli problem of reconstructing a curve from its
                        Jacobian from a computational point of view. Following Dubrovin, we
                        design machinery to solve this problem effectively, which builds on methods in numerical
                        algebraic geometry. We verify these methods via numerical
                        experiments with curves up to genus 7. This is joint work with Daniele Agostini and Demir Eken.

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: Thurston's theory of homeomorphisms from a compact surface of genus
                        greater than one to itself, classifies such maps (and their mapping
                        classes) into three types: periodic, pseudo-Anosov, or reducible - where the surface decomposes
                        into pieces on which the restrictions of the map are
                        either periodic or pseudo-Anosov. The pseudo-Anosov case is thus of great interest in studying
                        these maps. In this case, an integrable quadratic
                        holomorphic differential exists on the surface w.r.t. a Riemann surface structure. When the
                        foliations of the quadratic differential are orientable, namely
                        when there is an Abelian differential preserved by the map, we will characterize the structure
                        of the surface and the pseudo-Anosov map in terms of a
                        permutation of integers.

                        <br><br>

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko that says that rank
                        polynomials of the distributive lattices of lower ideals of fence
                        posets are unimodal. We do this by introducing a related class of circular fence posets and
                        proving a stronger version of the conjecture due to
                        McConville, Sagan and Smyth. We show that the rank polynomials of circular fence posets are
                        symmetric and conjecture that unimodality holds
                        except in some particular cases. We also apply the recent work of Elizalde, Plante, Roby and
                        Sagan on rowmotion on fences and show many of their
                        homomesy results hold for the circular case as well (joint work with Mohan Ravichandran).

                        In these considerations we end up at some point at the Riemann zeta function which encodes the
                        mysteries of the distribution of primes.
                        We explain how Riemann deciphered part of this encoding and mention some relations to modern
                        physics.

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: We all know about computer algebra packages like Maple or Matlab, which
                        can be used to do calculations. But there are
                        other computer programs called things like Coq or Lean or Isabelle/HOL, which can be used to
                        check or generate mathematical
                        proofs. Such systems have existed for decades but it is only recently that the research
                        mathematical community have begun to take
                        them seriously. I will give an overview of what has been happening over the last few years, and
                        also why I think it might begin to
                        matter to our community. I don't think that computers will be automatically proving the Riemann
                        Hypothesis any time soon, but I do
                        think that maybe they will soon be able to help us with our research, in areas where Maple and
                        Matlab are no use. I will assume the
                        audience has a basic mathematical background but I will not assume any knowledge of computers or
                        computer proof systems.

                        Başlık/Titre/Title: Solving Fermat Type Equations Via Modular Approach
                        <br><br>

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: The asymptotic Fermat conjecture(AFC) states that for a
                        number field K and for sufficiently large primes, the equation x^p+y^p+z^p=0 has only trivial
                        solutions.
                        The strategy which is referred as the "modular method" to solve the Fermat equation, used by
                        Wiles in his famous
                        proof, can be adapted to attack AFC and its several different generalizations. Similar results
                        are quite rare for
                        other Fermat type equations such as x^p+y^q=z^r although the solutions of this equation have
                        been studied over
                        rationals. In this talk, I will mention some recent asymptotic results for the classical Fermat
                        equation
                        as well as some other Fermat type equations over number fields.

                        This talk is based on joint works with Isik and Ozman.

                        Özet/Résumé/ Abstract: Conze-Lesigne systems are abelian measure-preserving dynamical systems
                        which are
                        isomorphic to their second Host-Kra-Ziegler factors. These factors (and their versions of higher
                        order) are
                        relevant &ZeroWidthSpace;in multiple recurrence and related topics in additive combinatorics
                        (e.g. Szemeredi's theorem).
                        In this talk, we present a structure theorem for Conze-Lesigne systems for actions of an
                        arbitrary countable discrete abelian group, describing such systems as an inverse limit of
                        translational systems G/L, where G is a locally compact nilpotent group of nilpotency class 2
                        and L is a lattice in G. Such structure theorems were previously known in the important special
                        cases of finitely generated abelian groups by work of Conze and Lesigne and direct sums of
                        finite fields by work of Bergelson, Tao, and Ziegler. We will review some of this literature by
                        way of illustrating examples. If time permits, we present an application of our structure
                        theorem to give a qualitative proof of the inverse theorem for the Gowers U^3-uniformity norm of
                        an arbitrary finite abelian group via a correspondence principle. This talk is based on work
                        jointly with Shalom and Tao. I will introduce and motivate the topic to a general mathematical
                        audience in the first half of my talk.

                            Biopolymers are able to form many complex nanostructures. Nature
                            uses folded proteins as carriers of functional properties or interactions
                            with other biopolymers. Bacause of complex interplay of interactions it
                            is very hard to predict the tertiary structure from the primary structure.
                            Designing completely new protein fold is even more challenging. In this
                            talk, we overview a self-assembly strategy for single-chain polypeptide
                            tetrahedron assembled from coiled-coil segments.

                        <p>Başlık/Titre/Title: Complex Symplectomorphisms, Kahler Geodesics and Representation Theory.

                        <p>Özet/Résumé/ Abstract <br>
                            The geodesics for the Mabuchi metric on the space H of Kahler metrics on a compact
                            symplectic manifold M correspond to solutions of a homogeneous complex Monge-Ampere (HCMA)
                            equation. The space H is an infinite dimensional analogue of the symmetric spaces of
                            noncompact type G_C/G for compact Lie groups G. In H the role of G is being played by the
                            group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms.

                            I will describe a method for reducing the relevant Cauchy problem for the HCMA eq with
                            analytic initial data to finding a related Hamiltonian flow followed by a
                            "complexification".

                            For Hamiltonian G-spaces, with G-invariant Kahler structure, the geodesic corresponding to
                            the norm square of the moment map or its Hamiltonian flow in imaginary time (= gradient flow
                            for the changing metric following the geodesic) leads to the convergence of the holomorphic
                            sections to sections supported on Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves.

                            For M=T*G, starting from the vertical or Schrodinger polarization, one obtains the
                            Segal-Bargman-Hall coherent state transform.

                            Les presques anneaux trouvent leur origine dans
                            les travaux de Faltings sur la théorie p-adique
                            de Hodge, où ils fournissent un outil clé pour
                            le preuve de son théorème de presque pureté, qui
                            à son tour est une profonde généralisation d'une
                            observation remontant à l'rticle fondateur de
                            Tate sur les groupes p-divisibles.
                            Plus recemment, les presques anneaux sont devenus
                            le socle sur lequel Scholze a bati sa théorie
                            des anneaux et espaces perfectoides, l'une des
                            plus spectaculaires trouvailles de la géométrie
                            arithmétique des dernières années.
                            Dans mon exposé j'introduirai les presques anneaux
                            et j'essayerai d'expliquer comment ils sont utilisés
                            dans la théorie p-adique de Hodge et dans la théorie
                            des espaces perfectoides.

                            Il s'agit de classifier les polynômes à l'aide de la structure de leur arbre à l'infini.
                            Après avoir rappelé la notion d'arbre àl'infini d'un polynôme àdeux variables, nous
                            introduisons des structures simples dans cet arbre, que nous appelons des peignes. Le
                            résultat principal que nous énonçons est le fait que le nombre de peignes est inférieur ou
                            égal à 1+2g, où g est le genre de la courbe générique. Dans le cas des polynômes rationnels,
                            à l'origine de cette étude, on obtient un arbre qui consiste en un seul peigne. A la fin de
                            l'exposé, nous étudions le cas où il existe des dicritiques de degré 1 et nous retrouvons
                            les arbres des polynômes rationnels simples.

                        <p>Başlık/Titre/Title: Convolutional, Recurrent and Deep Neural Networks
                        </p>

                        <p>Özet/Résumé/ Abstract <br>
                            Deep Neural Networks are artificial neural networks with a specific topology belonging to a
                            family of such topologies. Use of many layers with gradually decreasing number of neurons,
                            and use of some specialized prediction and training methods are characteristic of DNNs.

                            Prominent differences between regular ANNs and DNNs consist of highly increased use of
                            layers in specific arrangements, use of specific nonlinear (i.e. ReLU), convolutional or
                            lossy maps to link these layers, and use of specific algorithms (i.e. regularization) to
                            prevent otherwise unexpected problems (i.e. vanishing/exploding gradients) during training.
                            For feature extraction and transformation, each layer uses the output from the previous
                            layer as input in order to learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to
                            different levels of abstraction which forms a hierarchy of concepts. Each layer learns to
                            transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation; deep
                            learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve
                            performance. Deep learning architectures are often constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer
                            method.

                            Deep learning models are vaguely inspired by information processing and communication
                            patterns in biological nervous systems, but they have too many structural and functional
                            differences from biological brains, which make them incompatible with neuroscience
                            evidences. (latter is a separate field called biologically plausible Spiking Neural
                            Networks)

                            The "deep" in "deep learning" refers to the number of layers through which the data is
                            transformed. Deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth.
                            The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output; hence it describes potential
                            causal connections between input and output. For feedforward NNs, the depth of the CAP is
                            that of the network; for recurrent NNs a signal may propagate through a layer multiple
                            times, thus CAP depth is potentially unlimited.

                            DNNs are interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem and probabilistic
                            inference:
                            For DNNs the universal approximation theorem concerns with information holding the capacity
                            of bounded width, unbounded depth networks. It's been proven that a DNN satisfying some
                            lower bound constraint on layer width can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function. (Lu,
                            Z. et al., 2017 The Expressive Power of Neural Networks)
                            The probabilistic interpretation features inference and optimization concepts; it considers
                            the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function. This interpretation led
                            to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in NNs.

                            (Joint work with H. Mourtada)

                            Abstract: One of the aim of Nash’ paper on the arcs spaces (1968) was to understand res-
                            olutions of singularities via the arcs living on the singular variety; in particular he
                            wanted to give a one to one correspondence between families of arcs and es- sential
                            exceptionnal divisors. J.Fernandez de Bobadilla and M.Pe Pereira (2011) have shown that such
                            a bijective correspondence for abstract resolutions of singular surfaces. But the proof does
                            not give a constructive way to get the resolution from the arcs space. With H.Mourtada, we
                            construct an embedded toric resolution of simple singularities from their jets schemes. It
                            is the result I will discuss in the talk.

                            In this talk we consider a number-theoretic question that interrelates two group
                            structures. An arithmetic progression sequence on rational numbers carries a pattern
                            that can be imitated in the universe of algebraic planar curves. We start with introducing
                            algebraic curves, with due attention to elliptic curves, then we discuss some of the aspects
                            of the arithmetic on these curves. We dene what we mean by an arithmetic progression
                            sequence within the globe of algebraic planar curves. We then display some of the old
                            and recent developments in the theory. Specically, we discuss the possibilities for the
                            length of these progression sequences. Finally, we present some open questions that
                            currently intrigue researchers.

                            In the construction of Hamiltonian reductions in symplectic geometry, interesting and rich
                            connections to Hilbert schemes, Calogero-Moser spaces, and rational spherical Cherednik
                            algebras have emerged over the last two decades. A Borel analogue of the classical general
                            linear group construction (realized after a reduction from the cotangent bundle of enhanced
                            Grothendieck-Springer resolutions) potentially opens doors for its connections to
                            isospectral Hilbert schemes, flag Hilbert schemes, and other algebraic varieties, that are
                            important to geometric representation theory, algebraic combinatorics, and quantum topology.

                            Our construction can also be realized by certain quiver flag varieties, appearing in the
                            geometric interplay in quiver Hecke algebras that categorify quantum groups.

                            I will discuss a Borel analogue of the cotangent bundle of the extended general linear Lie
                            algebra, discussing the complete intersection of the zero fiber of a moment map (as
                            conjectured by Thomas Nevins), an enumeration of the irreducible components, and a Borel

                        </p>

                        <p>Özet/Résumé/ Abstract <br>
                            In the works of E. Fried and J. Kollár in 1978 and of M. Fried in 1980, it has been shown
                            that any finite group is the automorphisms group of a finite extension of the field of the
                            rational numbers. This is a positive answer to a weak form of the traditional Inverse Galois
                            Problem of Galois theory, which ask if, whether or not, every finite group G appears as the
                            Galois group of a Galois extension of Q. Since the work of Fried- Kollár/Fried, several
                            advances have been made on this weak form. The most recent is from 2017 and is due to E.
                            Paran and F. Legrand who show that this weak form is actually true on any Hilbertian field.
                            In a recent work with François Legrand, we explain how to provide examples on non-Hilbertian
                            fields. In particular, we show that for any finite group G there exists a field k on which
                            the weak form of the Inverse Galois Problem is true but such that G is not Galois over k.
                            This result thus shows the gap that exists between the Inverse Galois Problem and its weak
                            form.

                            Given a Poincaré complex $X$, we say a bundle $\xi$ over $X$ is realized by the
                            normal bundle of a manifold $M$, if $\xi$ is pulled back from the normal bundle of $M$ along
                            a
                            homotopy equivalence $X\rightarrow M$. The problem of determining such bundles over an
                            arbitrary Poincaré complex is a difficult problem and is related to classical problems of
                            surgery theory. In this talk, we will discuss some methods of approaching to this problem
                            and talk about solutions for certain cases of $X$. In particular, we will discuss conditions
                            on bundles over $X$ that guarantee they are realized by normal bundles of manifolds, for $X$
                            belonging to a certain class of homology spheres.

                        <p>Özet/Résumé/ Abstract <br>
                            Categorification is a recent philosophy that aims to enrich current set-based theories by
                            introducing a new layer of morphisms, hence obtaining a category based theory. A classical
                            example is homology theories that recover Euler characteristic through their dimensions, but
                            offer more since one can talk about morphisms between homology groups now. After an
                            introduction to categorification, we will see how this idea was applied to a Heisenberg
                            algebra, through its connection to representation theory of the symmetric group .

                        <p>Özet/Résumé/ Abstract <br>
                            Crystal bases were introduced by Kashiwara in his study of the representation
                            theory of quantized universal enveloping algebras. A crystal graph is a directed, colored
                            graph with vertex set given by the crystal basis and directed edges given by deformations of
                            the Chevalley generators and that encodes information about the corresponding
                            representations and their tensor product. In this joint project with Assaf, we define
                            explicit
                            operators on semistandard shifted tableaux and use Stembridge's characterizationto show that
                            these operators have a crystal structure, giving a new proof that Schur P-polynomials are
                            Schur positive. We then add queer crystal operators (odd Kashiwara operators) that give the
                            semistandard shifted tableaux of a given shape the structure of a connected queer crystal.
                            We
                            also give axioms for queer regular graphs parallel to Stembridge axioms for type A crystals
                            that give a partial local characterization of queer crystals.

                        <p>Özet/Résumé/ Abstract <br>
                            In 1984, I was able to obtain a parametrization of the Boy surface by eliminating the
                            Whitney umbrellas of the Steiner surface using the so-called hyperbolic confluence of pairs
                            of singularities. As a result, the Boy surface appears to be a real algebraic surface of
                            degree six. However, the construction was a mix of geometry, differential topology and
                            singularity theory. In this talk I want to investigate the question in the complex algebraic
                            geometry field. We intend to characterize the Boy surface as an complex algebraic surface
                            subjected to natural conditions.

                        <p>Abstract/ Özet: <br>
                            This is joint work with Piotr Kowalski. A G-field is a field, together with an action of a
                            group G by field automorphisms. <br>
                            Our purpose is to give an axiomatization of the theory of "generic", i.e. existentially
                            closed G-fields. If such axiomatization for <br>
                            the class of existentially closed G-fields exists, we call the resulting theory G-TCF. If G
                            is the trivial group then G-TCF is the theory<br>
                            of algebraically closed fields, ACF. If G is the group of integers, then G-TCF exists and
                            its theory is very well studied ACFA, the theory <br>
                            of algebraically closed fields with a generic automorphism. It is also known that G-TCF
                            exist if G is finite, and G is a finitely generated free group.<br>
                            A natural generalization of finite groups and free groups is the class of virtually free
                            groups. Our main theorem says that, when G is a finitely generated <br>
                            virtually free group, then G-TCF exists. We also give field theoretic propertied of
                            G-fields.

                            We will show a link between the arc space (which is an algebro-geomtric object) and the
                            identities of partitions of integer numbers: <br>
                            a partition of a positive integer number is simply a way of writing it as a sum of positive
                            integer numbers. Integer partitions have a long and <br>
                            beautiful history in number theory. The link that we will describe, gives a new point of
                            view on known results and gives new identities.

                            The Garden of Eden theorem was established by Edward Moore and John Myhill in 1963. It
                            states that a cellular automaton is surjective if and only if it <br>
                            satisfies a weak form of injectivity known as pre-injectivity. In 1999, Mikhail Gromov
                            suggested that the Garden of Eden theorem could be extended to a suitable<br>
                            class of hyperbolic dynamical systems. In this talk, I will discuss the classical Garden of

                            Let G be a finite group, p a prime number and k an algebraically closed field of
                            characteristic p. Modular representation theory of <br>
                            finite groups aims to understand the blocks of kG which are the indecomposable two-sided
                            ideals of the group algebra kG. To achieve this<br>
                            aim many categorical equivalences between module categories of the block algebras are
                            introduced.Among these, we are concerned with the<br>
                            stable equivalence of Morita type. In this talk after a brief introduction to the subject,
                            the role of Scott modules in this picture will be discussed.<br>
                            Then a recent result with a joint work with S. Koshitani among these lines will be
                            presented.

                        </p>

                        <p>Abstract/ Özet: <br>
                            Free probability, introduced by Voiculescu in the early 1980's is a general method to study
                            asymptotic statistics of random matrices.<br>
                            It also provides a parallel theory of probability with the notion of independence replaced
                            by so called 'freeness'. Research over the the last <br>
                            three decades has shown the existence of 'free' analogues of results ranging from central
                            limit theorems to the existence of Brownian motion to De Finetti type <br>
                            theorems in free probability. Freeness however does not exist in finite dimensions and as
                            such free probability is inherently qualitative in the results it yields<br>
                            for random matrices.In 2015, Adam Marcus proposed a theory called 'finite free probability'
                            that seems capable of providing non-asymptotic results.<br>
                            There are several questions that are wide open in this new setting and I will mention some
                            current work of mine that seems to clarify at least one of them.

                            Distributive laws, also known as "factorization systems," are useful tools. I will start by
                            few examples, and then explain how <br>
                            an unramified graph covering is equivalent to a pair of groupoids linked together with a
                            distributive law. I will also talk about the<br>
                            beautiful Galois theory behind such coverings. Time permitting, I will comment on the
                            homological ramifications of having such pairs.

                            A fiber bundle is said to be "indecomposable" if it cannot be expressed as a fiber product
                            of fiber bundles of smaller fiber dimension, <br>
                            and is "stably indecomposable" if its fiber product with any other fiber bundle cannot be
                            decomposed into (i.e. expressed as a fiber product of) fiber bundles of smaller fiber
                            dimension. <br>
                            The talk will be about the relationship between these two concepts.

                        </p>

                        <p>Abstract/ Özet: <br>
                            The talk will be consisting of two main parts. In the first one, a gentle introduction to
                            the geometric mechanics will be presented. <br>
                            Accordingly, some basic notions of the theory namely, Lie groups, Lie algebras, Poisson
                            manifolds, and Hamiltonian systems will be summarized. <br>
                            Several examples will be provided. <br>

                            In the second part, we shall address the problem of determining the matched equations of
                            motion of two interacting systems (whose configuration spaces are Lie groups) <br>
                            governing the coupled system starting with the individual equations of motions in
                            Hamiltonian form. The configuration spaces of the systems being Lie groups is imperative
                            here <br>
                            in order to define the mutual actions. We shall present the theory of matched dynamics and
                            particularly write the matched Lie-Poisson equations. <br>
                            It will be shown that the theory of matched dynamics is a generalization of the
                            well-developed semi-direct product theory.

                        <p>Abstract/ Özet: <br>
                            The Igusa local zeta function is a generating function which counts,
                            for a fixed prime number p, the number of solutions of polynomial congruence f(x) ≡ 0 modulo
                            p, p2, p3, and so on. <br>
                            Naturally, such a quantity bears deep relations to other important mathematical ideas from
                            number theory, algebraic geometry and singularities theory. <br>
                            In this work we explore some computational aspects of the Igusa local zeta function
                            associated to the nondegenerate plane cubics over ℚp for p≠ 2,3.

                            Self-dual codes have a rich mathematical theory and they have canonical connections to
                            finite designs
                            and unimodular lattices. <br>
                            We study self-dual and formally self-dual codes over local Frobenius rings of
                            order 16 and give their binary images under a Gray map.

                        <p>Titre/ Noncommutative Algebraic Geometry on a Leavitt Path Algebra of Polynomial Growth

                        </p>

                        <p>Abstract/ Özet: <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Algebraic Geometry classically studies the geometry of sets given as the solutions to
                            polynomial equations via the commutative algebra of "regular" functions on this set.
                            <br>
                            According to the Gelfand-Grothendieck philosophy a commutative ring should be thought of as
                            a ring of functions: Complex valued continuous functions for (locally) compact
                            <br>
                            Hausdorff topological spaces (Gelfand-Naimark duality) where the points of the space
                            correspond to maximal ideals; polynomial functions for affine varieties where we need all
                            prime ideals (with the Zariski topology) to keep functoriality.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Connes's noncommutative geometry noncommutative rings are also regarded as rings of
                            functions.
                            <br>
                            Now there are several candidates for the "points": maximal ideals, primitive ideals and
                            simple modules (these are equivalent when the ring is commutative).
                            <br>
                            The general consensus is that there are never enough points (for instance to recover the
                            original ring).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Leavitt Path Algebras are constructed from the geometric data of a di(rected )graph G. A
                            theorem of Alahmadi, Alsulami, Jain and Zelmanov says that they have polynomial growth if
                            and only if the cycles of G are mutually disjoint.
                            <br>
                            In this case there seem to be enough points (at least for algebraic quantum spheres) after
                            some tweaking of the spectrum (= space of points).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While this is a sequel to the seminar by Ayten Koc, familiarity with that talk is not a
                            prerequisite. Relevant concepts will be (re)defined and graduate students are the target
                            audience.

                        <p>Abstract/ Özet: <br>
                            The aim of this talk is to present the density versions of the Hales–Jewett

                            Theorem and the Carlson–Simpson Theorem. <br>
                            The Hales–Jewett Theorem is one of

                            the most representing results in Ramsey theory. <br>
                            Its density version was first proved

                            by H. Furstenberg and Y. Katznelson in 1991 using Ergodic Theory. <br>
                            However,

                            since then, combinatorial proofs have been discovered. The Density Hales–Jewett

                            Theorem has as a consequence <br>
                            Szem ́eredi’s Theorem on arithmetic progressions as

                            well as its multidimensional version. <br>
                            The Density Carlson–Simpson Theorem is an

                            extension of the Density Hales–Jewett Theorem and concerns the space of the left

                            variable words.

                            Contrary to popular belief, linear dynamical systems can be chaotic. <br>
                            However, in order to find a chaotic linear map, one needs to work on <br>
                            infinite-dimensional metric spaces. <br>
                            We will make an introduction to Linear Dynamics, <br>
                            which is a new and active branch of Functional Analysis.<br>
                            We will also talk about a recent result of Rebecca Sanders and myself <br>
                            about dense manifolds of disjoint hypercyclic operators.

                        <p>Titre/ Başlık:Polyhedral Omega: A new linear Diophantine system solver
                        </p>
                        <p>Abstract/ Özet: Polyhedral Omega is a new algorithm for solving linear
                            Diophantine systems (LDS), i.e., for computing a multivariate rational function
                            representation of the set of all non-negative integer solutions to a system of
                            linear equations and inequalities. Polyhedral Omega combines methods from partition
                            analysis with methods from polyhedral geometry. In particular, we combine MacMahon's
                            iterative approach based on the Omega operator and explicit formulas for its evaluation
                            with geometric tools such as Brion decomposition and Barvinok's short rational function
                            representations. In this way, we connect two branches of research that have so far
                            remained separate, unified by the concept of symbolic cones which we introduce.
                            The resulting LDS solver Polyhedral Omega is significantly faster than previous
                            solvers based on partition analysis and it is competitive with state-of-the-art
                            LDS solvers based on geometric methods. Most importantly, this synthesis of
                            ideas makes Polyhedral Omega by far the simplest algorithm for solving linear
                            Diophantine systems available to date. This is joint work with Felix Breuer.

                        <p>Abstract/ Özet: In this talk we describe a fibration theorem for real analytic
                            maps $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^p$
                            with arbitrary singularities. Now suppose that $f$ satisfies Thom's property with respect
                            to a Whitney stratification and let $g:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^k$ be another real
                            analytic map with isolated singularity at the origin in the stratified sense.
                            We give a Le-Greuel type formula which
                            relates the Euler-Poincaré characteristic of the fibres of $f$ and $(f,g)$.

                            When $f$ and $(f,g)$ are isolated complete intersections we construct an integer valued
                            invariant called the curvatura integra which gives the Euler characteristic of the fibres.

                        Titre/ başlık: Some Problems and A Possible Conjecture On Half-Integral Weight Modular Forms
                        <br>

                        Résumé/Özet: By the celebrated work of G. Shimura, our knowledge on modular forms of
                        half-integral weight has started to grow. Like in the case of integral weight, they also have
                        arithmetic significance, so both have attracted attention for many years. Recently, one of the
                        breakthrough and very significant results in pure mathematics is the proof of the Sato-Tate
                        conjecture for non-CM modular eigenforms of integral weight (even for Hilbert eigenforms) by
                        Taylor, Barnet-Lamb, Geraghty and Harris. A special case of the Sato-Tate theorem states that
                        signs of coefficients of integral weight Hecke eigenforms are equidistributed. That such should
                        also be the case for half-integral weight forms was conjectured by Kohnen and Bruinier. In this
                        talk, we will discuss the motivation behind this question and explain how the Shimura lift and
                        the Sato-Tate theorem can be exploited to obtain sign equidistribution for certain subsets of
                        the coefficients of half-integral weight eigenforms. Finally, we are interested in the following
                        question: Is it possible state a conjecture like Sato-Tate in the case of half-integral weight
                        modular forms where the question is much more complicated. We will conclude with reporting
                        recent developments on this problem.

                        Résumé/Özet: In this talk, we first discuss an asymptotic quantity, namely the torsion-limit,
                        for algebraic function fields over finite fields. Then we give some new bounds for the torsion
                        limit of certain towers of function fields over finite fields. Furthermore, using some bounds on
                        the torsion limits, we will give some recent results regarding the construction of arithmetic
                        secret sharing schemes.

                        the Prym varieties of its cyclic covers in characteristic p&gt;0. Prym variety is a central
                        object of study in arithmetic geometry like Jacobian variety. The goal of the talk is to
                        understand various existence results about Prym varieties such as when g&gt;2, Prym varieties of
                        all unramified cyclic degree ell covers of a generic curve of genus g and p-rank f are ordinary.

                        Résumé/Özet: This is a general talk on rational conformal field theory for pointed stable
                        curves. I will give the construction of a rational conformal field theory, and a realization of
                        it in representation theory of affine Lie algebras. Then I will demonstrate how these objects
                        are related to theta functions.

                        Titre/ başlık: Parabolic Stein Manifolds <br>

                        Résumé/Özet:An open Riemann surface is called parabolic in case every bounded subharmonic
                        function on it reduces to a constant. Several authors introduced seemingly different analogs of
                        this notion for complex manifolds of arbitrary dimension. In the first part of this expository
                        talk, I will compile these notions of parabolicity, compare them and look at some examples. Then
                        I will relate some of these notions to the linear topological type of the Fréchet space of
                        global analytic functions on the given Stein manifold. This will allow us to look at these
                        notions from functional analysis point of view. Finally, I will consider “polynomials” on
                        S-parabolic manifolds and report on some general results about these objects.
                        <br>
                        Most of what I will report in this talk is from joint work with A. Sadullaev.

                        Résumé/Özet: Flat structures are formulated by K. Saito in the course of the study of moduli
                        spaces of
                        isolated singularities.
                        The purpose of this talk is to introduce the notion of flat structures without potentials,
                        formulate
                        one of generalisations of ordinary differential equations of Okubo type
                        to several variables case and give examples of potential vector fields related with algebraic
                        solutions of Painlev\'{e} VI,
                        free divisors arising from 1-parameter deformations of singularities on plane curves and
                        discriminants of complex reflection groups.

                        Titre/ başlık: Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems with Specified Eigenvalues <br>

                        Résumé/Özet: Nonlinear eigenvalue problems have drawn substantial interest
                        in the last two decades in numerical analysis. An important
                        concept regarding them is the backward error, that is how much
                        one has to perturb them so that a specified scalar
                        becomes an eigenvalue. Here we consider the following more
                        general question: given an analytic matrix-valued function,
                        where is a nearest one possessing a set of prescribed eigenvalues
                        located? We derive a singular value optimization characterization
                        for such nearest matrix-valued functions with respect to the
                        operator norm induced by the l2 norm. Our derivation benefits from the root
                        canonical form for a nonlinear eigenvalue problem (generalization of the
                        Jordan canonical from), generalized Sylvester operators, as well as
                        tools from complex analysis.

                        This is a joint work with Michael Karow and Daniel Kressner.

                        Titre/ başlık: Geometry of oscillating integrals and Dubrovin conjecture <br>

                        Résumé/Özet: We consider the oscillating integral defined by the polynomial phase function f(x)
                        with non-degenerate singular points. So called « Lefschetz thimble» can be constructed for each
                        singular point of f(x). This integral can be regarded as Laplace transform of the fibre integral
                        associated to the non-singular variety f^{-1}(c). It turns out (F .Pham) that the intersection
                        indices of vanishing cycles of the variety f^{-1}(c) coincide with those of Lefschetz thimbles
                        (regarded as one dimension higher cycles in a relative homology). We show that the elements of
                        the Stokes matrix defined for the oscillating integral calculates exactly the intersection
                        indices mentioned above.
                        <br>As an application we shall discuss the question on the Stokes matrix S for the quantum
                        cohomology of weighted projective space pour P. Namely we shall present a positive answer to the
                        hypothesis proposed by Boris Dubrovin who predicted that the Stokes matrix S coïncide coincides
                        with the Gram matrix of the exceptional collection of coherent sheaves on P. This is a
                        collaboration with Kazushi Ueda.

                        Résumé/Özet: The logarithmic height function is a function that measures the complexity of an
                        algebraic number. This is a fundamental notion at the basis of diophantine geometry.
                        In this talk, we study the set of algebraic numbers with small height elements in terms of model
                        theory, in particular we study their combinatorial properties. Then we investigate how this
                        properties are related to some number theoretic results.

                        Résumé/Özet: I will connect several notions relating the structural and dynamical properties of
                        a graph. Among them are the topological entropy, the spectral radius of the graph’s adjacency
                        matrix, the Randi\'c index, and the degree assortativity. We will see that a hierarchical
                        structure; namely, satisfies a breadth-first search ordering with decreasing degrees is a
                        necessary structure for the extremal graphs that maximize these properties.

                        Résumé/Özet: There is a strong connection between Analysis and Probability Theory. The classical
                        results of Analysis can be obtained by using tools of Martingale Theory, and Brownian motion as
                        the underlying process. Brownian motion is a very specific L\'evy process which embraces many
                        ``nice" properties where these properties allows one to reproduce probabilistic alternatives of
                        classical tools. On the other hand, it is possible to study more general L\'evy processes with
                        some cost.\\

                        In this talk, we will discuss the question that to what extent we can generalise this process
                        provided that the connection with Analysis is not lost. We will consider some results on bounded
                        linear operators on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ when the underlying process is taken to be the symmetric
                        stable process which shares some fundamental properties of Brownian motion. We will argue the
                        tools obtained by means of this more general process, and define a new class of harmonic
                        functions to work with. We will also provide a Harnack's Inequality for this new class of
                        harmonic functions.

                        Résumé / Özet : Je vais parler d'études des outils classiques de la topologie algébrique dans le
                        cadre difféologique. Parmi ces outils on se penche particulièrement sur les théories
                        homologiques et cohomologiques généralisées. Un autre objectif est de montrer que les espaces
                        difféologiques offrent un cadre assez naturel afin d’étudier les espaces singuliers. Parmi ces
                        espaces singuliers, on étudie particulièrement les pseudo-variétés contrôlées à la Thom-Mather.

                        Titre/ başlık: GIT of Hilbert schemes of curves linearized in fixed degree and applications<br>

                        Abstract/Özet: I will describe briefly constructions of families of projective quotients of
                        Hilbert schemes of curves and their applications both as log-canonical models of the moduli
                        space of stable curves and as moduli spaces in their own right for new classes of curves.
                        Because a degree parameter that could be taken ''sufficiently large'' in prior constructions
                        must be fixed to go further, classical asymptotic methods for analysing stability are no longer
                        effective. After reviewing this setup, I will outline a new method, joint with David Swinarski,
                        for analysing stability in fixed degree for very special varieties, and conclude by explaining
                        how the method is applied in recent work of Jarod Alper, Maksym Fedorchuk and David Smyth.

                        Abstract/Özet: The aim of the talk is to introduce some of the important facts and problems on
                        curves over finite fields. The number of rational points of such a curve is bounded from above
                        by the Hasse-Weil bound and curves reaching this upper bound are called maximal curves. We will
                        pay particular attention to maximal cuves, especially to Hermitian curve since it is the most
                        interesting maximal curve for various reasons.

                        Mathematicians or Physicists? <br>

                        Abstract/Özet: One of the seven Millenium Problems announced in 2000 by the Clay Foundation
                        was the “mass gap problem”. This problem is still open and concerns the proof of quark
                        confinement conjecture,
                        crucial for the success of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in sub-nuclear physics.
                        After a quick, broad review of QCD as a quantized field theory, I want to comment on its
                        asymptotic freedom and
                        some consequences of UV-IR duality it implies.

                        Abstract/Özet: Rota-Baxter operators and Rota-Baxter algebras have appeared in a wide range of
                        areas in pure and applied mathematics (probability, combinatorics, Quantum field theory, algebra
                        ….). It turns out that they are closely related to several algebraic structures.
                        In this talk, I will review the historical developments and some basics. Furthermore, I will
                        describe a twisted version and its relationships with some other algebraic structures.

                        Abstract/Özet: In this talk I will present the kite of a plane curve singularity :
                        a bidimensional simplicial complex, which embeds canonically in the space of real
                        semivaluations of the local ring of the ambient surface. It allows to compare
                        all the combinatorial encodings used before in the study of such singularities,
                        and to follow geometrically the computations done with them. <br>
                        This is joint work with Garcia Barroso and Gonzalez Perez.

                        Titre/ başlık: Real 3-manifolds can be obtained from real 3-sphere via surgery <br>

                        Abstract/Özet: A real 3-manifold is a 3-manifold with an orientation preserving involution.
                        3-sphere has a unique real structure with nonempty fixed point set up to equivariant isotopy.
                        It is well-known that every 3-manifold can be obtained from the 3-sphere via +1 and -1 surgeries
                        along a finite collection of knots. In this talk we will prove that any real 3-manifold can be
                        obtained from the real 3-sphere via surgery along a finite "recursively invariant" collection of
                        knots.

                        Abstract/Özet: In this talk we present our construction of a characteristic map, using a
                        "SAYD-twisted" cyclic cocycle, by which we transfer the characteristic classes of transversely
                        orientable foliations into the cyclic cohomology of a certain noncommutative algebra. We carry
                        out the explicit computation in codimensions 1 and 2. In codimension 1, we show how our result
                        matches with the (only explicit) computation done by Connes-Moscovici, and in codimension 2 we
                        present the transverse fundamental class, the Godbillon-Vey class, and the other four residual
                        classes as cyclic cocycles.

                        Then I will explain (part of) our work, where we establish an S-duality relation between the two
                        massive theories obtained from twisted compactifcations of heterotic and IIA string theories
                        down to four dimensions.

                        Titre/ başlık: Finite dimensional representations of SL_2 over maximal order in a number field
                        <br>

                        Abstract/Özet: In various applications of automorphic forms it becomes crucial to know the
                        finite dimensional representations of SL_(2,O), where O is a maximal order in a number field.
                        There are amazingly open questions concerning these representations. But recently there has been
                        some progress. In particular, we determined all linear characters of SL(2,O) and we applied the
                        general theory of Weil representations of locally compact abelian groups invented by Weil to
                        generate interesting family of representations of SL(2,O) which possibly contain all finite
                        dimensional representations of SL(2,O) of finite image."

                        Titre/ başlık: Uniform Versions of the Mordell-Lang Conjecture for Multiplicative Groups <br>
                        Abstract/Özet: The Mordell-Lang Conjecture (MLC) concerns finitely generated subgroups of
                        abelian varieties, however, there are analogous statements in the "non-compact" case: namely the
                        case of the (cartesian powers of) multiplicative group, G_m. (Sometimes, MLC is formulated for
                        semi-abelian varieties to include this case.)

                        In very heuristic terms, in the multiplicative group case, MLC says "the addition doesn't give
                        new information about finitely generated multiplicative groups of fields." (This will be made
                        clear in this talk.)

                        We isolate the conlusion of MLC as an abstract property for subgroups of G_m. It turns out that
                        many groups other than finitely generated ones have this property. Moreover, some of them
                        satisfy a uniform version of it. Vaguely, this corresponds to the function field field case of
                        MLC.

                        In this talk, after making everything above more accurate, we prove that certain finitely
                        generated groups have this "uniform" Mordell-Lang Property.

                        Titre/ başlık: An asymptotic Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture <br>
                        Abstract/Özet: The conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) is one of the Clay Millennium
                        problems that links the arithmetic invariants of an elliptic curve to its analytic invariants.
                        Most of this talk will be devoted to explaining the contents of this conjecture and stating its
                        asymptotic variant. As time permits, I will sketch a proof of the asymptotic BSD for CM elliptic
                        curves, which relies on the Iwasawa theoretic study of the Kato-Beilinson elements and the
                        reciprocity law that relates them to relevant L-functions.

                        in shallow water <br>
                        Abstract/Özet: In this talk, we study the local well-posedness of a periodic nonlinear equation
                        for surface waves of moderate amplitude in shallow water. We use an approach due to Kato which
                        is based on semigroup theory for quasi-linear equations. We also show that singularities for the
                        model equation can occur only in the form of wave breaking, in particular surging breakers.

                        Abstract/Özet: Let $f(\bfz,\bar\bfz)$ be a mixed polynomial with strongly non-degenerate face
                        functions. We consider a canonical toric modification $\pi:\,X\to \BC^n$ and a
                        polar modification $\pi_{\BR}:Y\to X$. We will show that the toric modification resolves
                        topologically the singularity of $V$ and the zeta function of the Milnor fibration of $f$ is
                        described by a formula of a Varchenko type.

                        Abstract/Özet: Logarithmic structures were introduced into algebraic geometry by Kato, Fontaine,
                        and Illusie as a generalization of the toric embeddings studied earlier by Mumford and others.
                        Roughly speaking, the theory furnishes a category where the nicest object is a smooth variety
                        equipped with a normal crossings divisor. We will survey some applications of this machinery in
                        the construction and study of various moduli spaces and in the context of degeneration formulas
                        in Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas theory. We will also discuss a version of this theory in
                        differential geometry---where manifolds with corners are the nicest objects---and explain how
                        this is related to the algebro-geometric side of the theory.

                        Abstract/Özet: La théorie des structures o-minimales est une généralisation de la

                        field of holomorphic dynamics. In the second section, we introduce a specific one parameter
                        family of transcendental entire functions. In the third part, we give a new concept termed
                        holomorphic explosion, which we derived from holomorphic motion. The last section is devoted to
                        an application of holomorphic explosion to the transcendental entire family in consideration.

                        Titre/ başlık: Black Box Groups <br>
                        Abstract/Özet: Black box groups are introduced as an idealised setting for randomised al-
                        gorithms for solving permutation and matrix group problems in computational
                        group theory. A black box group G is a finite group whose elements are encoded
                        as 0-1 strings of uniform length and the group operations are performed by an
                        oracle ('black box'). Given strings representing g, h in G, the black box can
                        compute the strings representing gh, g^{-1} and decide whether g = h. In this
                        context, a natural task is to find a probabilistic algorithm which determines
                        the isomorphism type of a group within given (arbitrarily small) probability of
                        error. More desirable algorithms, called constructive recognition algorithms, are
                        the ones producing an isomorphism between a black box copy of a finite group
                        and its natural copy.<br>
                        A simple observation on the recognition algorithms in black box group theory
                        is that procedures are based on checking whether some first order formulae
                        satisfied by the given black box group. I will focus on this observation and
                        discuss constructive recognition of black box groups of Lie type. Along the way,
                        I will explain how we define a standard Frobenius automorphism in a black
                        box group isomorphic to (P)SL(2, q) and construct (or interpret) of a black
                        box field in black box groups using only black box group operations. If time
                        permits, I will talk about the interpretation of inverse transpose map and graph
                        automorphisms, and the corresponding constructions in the black box groups of
                        Lie type.<br>
                        This is a joint work with Alexandre Borovik.

                                Title/ başlık: Comovement between stock and bond return in Turkey.<br>
                                We try to determine the relation between stock returns and changes in interest rates and
                                attribute this relation to one of two competing hypotheses: similarity in valuation
                                methods implying a negative relation and need for a portfolio reallocation implying a
                                positive correlation. We find a negative correlation (-0.33), hence support the first
                                hypothesis. However, this correlation has weakened in the period after the subprime
                                crisis of 2007 (-0.37 vs. -0.28). Interestingly, sharp decreases in interest rates are
                                associated with high positive correlations while sharp increases are associated with
                                high negative correlations. This reveals an asymmetry in the relation between stock and
                                bond returns. We also find that some sectorial indices have different sensitivities to
                                interest rate changes.<br><br><br>

                                Resumé/özet: To a valued field one can canonically associate its residue field and value
                                group. It is natural to ask the following question: if two valued fields have "similar"
                                valued groups and "similar" residue fields how much are they similar as valued fields?
                                For example, (Q_p,v_p) and (F_p((t)), v_t) have the same residue field (F_p) same and
                                the value group (Z) and Ax-Kochen and Ershov theorem establish a "tight" similarity
                                between this two fields that answers a conjecture of Artin. I will discuss the analogous
                                situation where the valued fields in question are respectively equipped by distinguished
                                automorphisms. <br><br><br>

                                algebraic cobordism.<br>
                                Abstract/Özet: Given a suitably generic morphism of vector bundles over a smooth scheme
                                X, the Chow ring fundamental classes of the degeneracy loci can be expressed by means of
                                the double Schubert polynomials. This result has an exact analogue in K^0(X), the
                                Grothendieck ring of algebraic vector bundles over X, provided one replaces the double
                                Schubert polynomials with the double Grothendieck polynomials. In this talk I will
                                illustrate the common framework existing behind this two results and how it can be
                                transported to algebraic cobordism, the universal oriented cohomology theory. I will
                                also explain how this approach allows, in the universal case of a full flag bundle, to
                                extend the result to connected K-theory, a cohomology theory that dominates both CH and
                                K^0, leading to the definition of a family of polynomials generalizing both Schubert and
                                Grothendieck polynomials. <br><br><br>

                                un peu plus, elle s’intéresse à l'étude de la transmission du savoir mathématique, en
                                conséquence plusieurs questions se constituent à savoir:<br>
                                - comment le savoir s'est-il construit.<br>
                                - quel est le rôle de l'enseignant vis à vis de ce savoir.<br>
                                - suffit-il seulement de remplir les têtes vides des apprenants?<br>
                                On se rend compte alors qu'on est convaincu que ceci ne se réduit seulement pas à
                                l'acquisition des contenus secs des mathématiques, c'est à partir de là que commence la
                                didactique. <br><br><br>

                                Titre/Başlık: Quivers, polytopes and toric varieties <br><br>
                                Abstract: A quiver is simply an oriented graph without oriented cycles. They are
                                frequently used to represent some of the important results in many areas of mathematics.
                                It has shown that every quiver leads to a reflexive polytope the one we call a flow
                                polytope. I will present a method to determine a finite list of quivers defining all d
                                dimensional flow polytopes up to isomorphism. Also, I will describe how we can associate
                                these purely combinatorial objects to toric varieties. One can ask if we can
                                "understand" toric varieties by looking at its associated quiver. It still remains as an
                                open question if one can find a criterion for smoothness of associated toric variety in
                                terms of quiver. <br><br><br>

                                various domains of mathematics, including numerical analysis and renormalisation. I will
                                present some of these algebraic structures, in particular on the vector space of
                                tree-indexed series, which can be
                                thought of as an analogue of formal power series. I will also describe some examples of
                                interesting tree-indexed series.<br><br><br>

                                Abstract: It is well known that any permutation w in the symmetric group Sn can be
                                represented as the product of some finite adjacent transpositions
                                si = (i; i + 1) where the index i runs from 1 to n - 1.
                                Among all such representations the ones which uses the minimum number of generators are
                                called reduced representations for w. The notion of reduced words has been catching high
                                attention, because of their appearances in many areas that algebraic combinatorics
                                interferes.
                                In this talk, we introduce a new combinatorial object ”tower tableaux" together with the
                                ”sliding algorithm" which appears as an important tool for studying reduced words in
                                many aspects.<br><br><br>

                                for example) have many properties in common with real algebraic curves. If a given

                                pseudoholomorphic curves, usually it is rather difficult to prove that it is
                                algebraically unrealizable.In my talk,I will discuss some cases when it is nevertheless

                                homogeneous gravity field, named after Euler, Lagrange and Kowalevski. Recent studies
                                for the integrable discrete systems show us the conspicuous relationships in unrelated
                                areas of research such as numerical algorithms, discrete geometry, cellular automaton,
                                quantum integrable systems and algebraic geometry tools. One of these studies, Bobenko
                                and Suris, use Poisson construction of discretizations which gives implicit equations of
                                motion. In this talk, we give a very different discretization method, called Hirota type
                                discretization, using the bilinear transformation method and obtain explicit equations
                                of motion. We give Hirota discretization of the motion of a rigid body with a fixed
                                center of mass named Euler Top.<br><br><br>

                                Abstract/Özet:
                                Les mathématiques de la prévision ont longtemps privilégié la notion de régularité
                                locale des modèles (conditions d'existence de solutions dans les EDP, propriété des
                                modèles statistiques garantissant la convergence des estimateurs paramétriques, etc). La
                                théorie de l'apprentissage statistique, quant à elle, propose des concepts de nature
                                combinatoire (complexités de Vapnik-Chervonenkis) ou géométriques (complexités de
                                Rademacher) comme garants de la qualité des modèles à vocation prédictive. La révolution
                                est de taille puisque cette approche récente permet d'aborder de front les questions
                                d'inférence relatives à l'exploitation de données en grande dimension. Elle nourrit
                                également de questionnements une communauté croissante de chercheurs confrontant
                                informaticiens et mathématiciens issus de spécialités diverses (probabilités,

                                commune. L'exposé se fera l'écho des avancées récentes au sein de cette théorie aux

                                Abstract/Özet: We explain how to initiate a classification of polynomials <em>f</em>
                                from C^n to C of degree <em>d</em> having the top Betti number of the
                                general fibre close to the maximum. We find a range in which the polynomial must have
                                isolated singularities and another range where it may have at most one line singularity
                                of Morse transversal type.
                                Our method uses deformations into particular pencils with non-isolated
                                singularities.

                                Title/Başlık: Cohomology of Bianchi Groups<br><br>

                                Abstract/Özet: Bianchi groups are groups of the form <em>SL(2,R)</em> where <em>R</em>
                                is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field. They arise naturally in the
                                study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and of certain generalizations of the classical modular
                                forms (called Bianchi modular forms) for which they assume the role of the classical
                                modular group <em>SL(2,Z)</em>.
                                In this latter sense, the study of Bianchi groups is fundamental for developing
                                Langlands' programme for <em>GL(2)</em> beyond totally real fields.<br>
                                The overall goal of this talk is to give the audience an overview of some of the
                                fundamental problems in the arithmetic aspects of the theory of Bianchi groups. After
                                giving the necessary background, I will start with a discussion of the problem of
                                understanding the behavior of the dimensions of the cohomology of Bianchi groups and
                                their congruence subgroups.
                                Next, I will focus on the amount of the torsion that one encounters in the cohomology .
                                Finally, I will discuss the arithmetic significance of these torsion
                                classes.<br><br><br>

                                Abstract/Özet:
                                Networks science constitutes a very dynamic field in current research. It can be
                                historically considered as the intersection of three preexisting domains: graph theory,
                                complex systems analysis and data mining. Due to the great flexibility of graphs used as
                                a modeling tool, the theoretical results obtained in network science are used in
                                numerous applied sciences, including biology, physics, computer science, economy, human
                                sciences, etc.<br>
                                In this presentation, we will first briefly describe the emergence of this relatively
                                new field, and present its goals. We will then introduce its main concepts, and the most
                                important results obtained in this field. We will also use a few real-world examples to
                                illustrate what these results practically mean and show their scope. Finally, we will
                                present the open questions currently at the center of the attention in this
                                field.<br><br><br>

                                resolution of singularities in characteristic zero and in positive characteristic (all
                                notions required to state the problem will be defined during the talk). If time permits,
                                we shall discuss the local version of the problem, so called "local uniformization with

                                Başlık/Title: Free Divisors and Painlevé Equations after M. Kato<br><br>

                                Özet/Abstract: First of all, I will explain the definition of free divisors and that of
                                systems of uniformization equations with singularities along such hypersurfaces which
                                are examples of holonomic systems. These two notions are formulated by K. Saito around
                                1970's. <br>
                                Then I restrict my attention to the case of hypersurfaces of an affine three dimensional
                                space.
                                I will show some examples of free divisors in this case and uniformization equations.
                                <br>
                                It turns out that the systems of uniformization equations are closely related with
                                Painlevé equation and its algebraic solutions.
                                Typical examples of free divisors are hypersurface defined by
                                the discriminant of real and complex reflection groups.
                                Recently M. Kato (Univ. of Ryukyus) clarified the relationship
                                between systems of uniformization equations with singularities along the discriminant
                                sets of reflection groups of rank three and algebraic solutions of Painlevé equation.
                                In my talk I will take a survey of free divisors, uniformization equations,
                                and discuss topics related with the results of M. Kato.<br><br><br>

                                Özet/Abstract: Briefly speaking, a standard group embedding is a normal projective
                                compactification of a reductive group. They can all be obtained as certain
                                projectivizations of reductive monoids.
                                A complete combinatorial description of the equivariant cohomology of rationally smooth
                                embeddings (a subclass that includes smooth and certain singular varieties), has been
                                obtained in
                                previous work by the author. An interesting open problem is to find an explicit set of
                                polynomial
                                generators for the various cohomology rings thus obtained. In this introductory talk, I

                                a survey of these topics and show how Newton's divided difference operators (and
                                Schubert calculus) could be effectively used to solve the above-mentioned problem. This

                                Özet/Abstract -The main focus of this talk will be finitely determinacy of multi
                                valued holomorphic map-germs with respect to the Right-Left
                                equivalence. By J. Mather's results, finite determinacy can be
                                characterised geometrically. An important tool for studying the
                                geometry of maps is the notion of multiple point spaces. The <em>k</em>-th
                                multiple point space of a finite map between topological spaces is the closure of the
                                set of <em>k</em>-tuple points having the same image under the map and distinct
                                components. In this talk, I shall discuss how to get algebraic criteria for finite
                                determinacy of map-germs of any corank from <em>3</em>-space to <em>4</em>-space using

                                Başlık /Title - Asymptotics on codes and on curves over finite fields.<br><br>

                                Özet/Abstract- The famous bound of Hasse-Weil for the number of rational points on
                                curves over finite fields (equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis in this context) was
                                shown by Ihara to be weaker as the genus of the curve grows. For a finite field with q
                                elements, Ihara then introduced the quantity A(q) that controls the asymptotic behaviour
                                of the number of rational points as the genus goes to infinity.To deal with A(q) one is
                                led to consider infinite towers of algebraic curves and to study their limits for the
                                ratios of (number of rational points) / (genus). We are going to motivate this
                                interesting mathematical subject by its connection to the asymptotics in Coding Theory,
                                which is a result due to Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink based on a construction of Goppa of linear
                                codes from algebraic curves over finite fields.<br><br><br>

                                Title/Başlık : Entanglement Swapping Model of DNA Replication <br><br>

                                Abstract/Özet: Molecular biology explains function of molecules by their geometrical and
                                electronical structures which are mainly determined by utilization of quantum effects in
                                chemistry. However,further quantum effects are not thought to play any significant role
                                in the essential processes of life. On the contrary, consideration of quantum
                                circuits/protocols and organic molecules as software and hardware of living systems that
                                are co-optimized during evolution, may be useful to pass over the dfficulties raised by
                                biochemical complexity and to understand the physics of life.<br>

                                In this talk, I will describe a quantum mechanical model of DNA replication with a
                                reliable qubit representation of the nucleotides. In the model: 1) molecular recognition
                                of a nucleotide is assumed to trigger an intrabase entanglement corresponding to a
                                superposition of different tautomer forms and 2) pairing of complementary nucleotides is
                                described by swapping intrabase entanglements with interbase entanglements. I will give
                                some examples of quantum circuits/protocols to be used to obtain intrabase and interbase
                                entanglements. Lastly, possible computational and experimental verification methods of
                                the model will be discussed.<br><br><br>

                                Özet/Abstract: After a short introduction to the subject, we will give classification of
                                sphere quadrangulations satisfying a condition of non-negative curvature, following
                                Thurston’s classification of sphere triangulations under the same condition. If time
                                permits, we will discuss some arithmetic applications of the classification, and its
                                relations to Picard-Terada-Deligne-Mostow theory. (joint with M.Uludag.) <br><br><br>

                                Abstract. These lectures will cover the main theorem of the Galois theory of fields
                                following closely the original approach of Galois. We will see how Galois theory proves
                                the nonexistence of a general algebraic formula for the roots of rational-coefficient
                                polynomials of degree 5 or more. We shall also illustrate the general theory in the
                                special case of cyclotomic fields and of finite fields.<br><br><br>

                                A Schwarz map of Appell's F_2 whose monodoromy group is related to the reflection group
                                of type D_4.<br><br>
                                Abstract. The system of differential equations for Appell's hypergeometric function
                                F_2(a,b,b',c,c';x,y) has four fundamental solutions. Let u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4 be such
                                solutions. If the monodromy group of the system is finite, the closure of the image of
                                the Schwarz map U(x,y)=(u_1(x,y),u_2(x,y),u_3(x,y),u_4(x,y)) is a hypersurface S of the
                                3-dimensional projective space {\bf P}$. Then S is defined by P(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4)=0 for a
                                polynomial P(t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4). It is M. Kato (Univ. Ryukyus) who determined the
                                parameter a,b,b',c,c' such that the monodromy group of the system for
                                F_2(a,b,b',c,c';x,y) is finite. It follows from his result that such a group is the
                                semidirect product of an irreducible finite reflection group G of rank four by an
                                abelian group. In this talk, we treat the system for F_2(a,b,b',c,c';x,y) with
                                (a,b,b',c,c')=(1/2,1/6,-1/6,1/3,2/3. In this case, the monodromy group is the semidirect
                                group of G by Z/3Z, where G is the reflection group of type D_4. The polynomial
                                P(t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4) in this case is of degree four. There are 16 ordinary singular points
                                in the hypersurface S. In the rest of my talk, I explain the background of the
                                study.<br><br><br>

                                Abstract. We consider the inverse problem of determining the time dependent magnetic

                                finite number of Neumann data, when the boundary measurement is taken on an appropriate
                                open subset of the boundary. We prove the Lispchitz stability of the magnetic potential
                                in the Coulomb gauge class by n times changing initial value suitably.<br><br><br>

                                classical and more recent. In particular, some author's results on model-theoretic
                                properties of unitriangular groups will be discussed.<br><br><br>

                                Equisingularity in complex surfaces.<br><br>
                                Abstract. We explain the equivalence for complex surfaces between Whitney regularity and
                                Zariski equisingularity criterion. We will give some applications such as the fact that
                                any surface Whitney regular along its singular locus has a smooth
                                normalisation.<br><br><br>

                                Abstract. We shall discuss Tate's Riemann-Roch theorem for number fields and the
                                peculiar nature that it implies for the cohomology of an Arakelov divisor (that is, a

                                infinity).<br><br><br>

                                Abstract. Le but de l'exposé est de faire voir un peu de théorie des modèles. J'ai
                                choisi de présenter un théorème de Macintyre (de 1971) disant qu'un corps omega-stable
                                est soit fini, soit algébriquement clos. Après avoir dit ce qu'est une théorie, ou un
                                modèle, et énoncé quelques questions typiques que se posent habituellement les
                                logiciens, je rappelerai deux invariants des espaces topologiques compacts dénombrables
                                qui permettent de les classifier à homéomorphisme près, avant de donner une preuve du
                                théorème de Macintyre, allégée grâce à des arguments de Poizat. L'exposé devrait être
                                accessible à tous.<br><br><br>

                                Invariants of hypergeometric groups for Calabi--Yau complete intersections in weighted
                                projective spaces<br><br>
                                Abstract. Let Y be a smooth Calabi--Yau complete intersection in a weighted projective
                                space. We show that the space of quadratic invariants of the hypergeometric group
                                associated with the mirror manifold of Y in the sense of Batyrev and Borisov is
                                one-dimensional and spanned by the Gram matrix of a classical generator of the derived
                                category of coherent sheaves on Y with respect to the Euler form. This is a confirmation
                                of an expected consequence of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture by
                                Kontsevitch.<br><br><br>

                                Abstract. Pseudoholomorphic curves are important objects by their role in different
                                subjects such as symplectic or contact geometry. I will present recent results on the
                                study of almost complex manifolds, concerning the (non)existence of pseudoholomorphic
                                curves and more generally of pseudoholomorphic maps.<br><br><br>
