                    <h3>DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS</h3>
                    <div class="text-dark">
                        <p>The undergraduate education in mathematics at Galatasaray University aims to provide students with a solid background in mathematics and develop analytical thinking skills while allowing them to develop a general scientific literacy. All courses are built to reconcile a strong background, diversity and the possibility of transition to other disciplines. The department, consisting of local and foreign faculty members, receives many visitors and organizes a research school every year to keep active research alive in different branches of mathematics.</p>

                        <p>With less than thirty students per class, the department offers students the opportunity to communicate directly with faculty members. This allows students to improve not only their knowledge in mathematics and foreign languages, but also their self­confidence. The undergraduate program in the department aims to develop students' skills on independent research and learning. From the fifth semester, each student is guided by a supervisor to choose elective courses according to her/his future dreams and talents. From the first semester on, there are several courses in computer science and applied mathematics in addition to courses in pure mathematics. Especially in the third and the fourth years there are a large number and variety of elective courses that allow students, after graduation, to continue their academic careers in various disciplines ranging from economics to engineering.</p>

                        <p>The graduation thesis prepared for these goals is particularly important and supervised by a faculty member following each step of the preparation and presentation of the work. Through the Erasmus Student Exchange Program, the department of mathematics offers to an average of 10 students per year the opportunity to continue their studies for one or two semesters at a European university. The language for the majority of teaching in the department is French, but some elective courses are given in English in order to enable the students to take full advantage of this possibility. Department of Mathematics currently runs a Master’s program in pure mathematics and plans to open a PhD program in Mathematics in the near future.</p>
